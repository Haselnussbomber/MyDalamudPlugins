    "Changelog": "- Added: An Utf8String Sanitize tab to see which characters are filtered with which flags.\n- Added: StringMaker now has a Preview window, which uses my SeStringEvaluator and allows you to test local parameters, if there are any.\n- Added: StringMaker now has a Print Evaluated button, which prints the string that went through my SeStringEvaluator (as seen in the Preview window) instead of the games MacroEncoder/TextModule/PronounModule whatever.\n- Added: The SeStringEvaluator now supports Fixed macros, except for the auto-translate/completion feature (I will add that another time).\n- Changed: For now, the SeStringEvaluator will simply pass through NonBreakingSpace, Hyphen and SoftHyphen payloads instead of converting them to their Unicode counterparts. I might revisit this decision in the future.\n- Fixed: In the SeStringEvaluator. the Sheet macro will now correctly generate strings for numeric columns.\n- Fixed: In the SeStringEvaluator, sheet name redirects passed to the Sheet macro will now be resolved.\n- Fixed: In the SeStringEvaluator, LevelPos macros now use the language that was defined with the context.\n- Updated: SeStrings rendered with the DebugRenderer will now display names for expressions of Fixed macros.\n- Updated: ClientStructs now at 70ac7923 (compare).",
