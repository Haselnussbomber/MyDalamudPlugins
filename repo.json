(Thanks to @MidoriKami)\n  - A config option \"Better readable KTK Node Names\" allows to toggle whether the original class name should be preserved ('ExampleName'), or if it should split on a capital letter ('Example Name', default).\n- Changed: Types are now loaded asynchronously when the plugin loads. This should fix an issue when the \"Auto-open HaselDebug\" option was enabled, where the last selected tab wasn't restored due to instances not being loaded.",

It's disabled for the Character window by default, because I think it looks worse there when it's on. But it's your choice!",
